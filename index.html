                Thank You for stopping by and checking out Muallaâ€™s Portfolio! <br>
                <br>
                Mualla Argin is a junior pursuing a bachelor of science degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/"> Texas A&M</a>.  Alongside her major Mualla is doing a minor in project management. She is also a 21-year-old film enthusiast that was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey">Turkey </a> and raised in Arizona. A quick random fun fact that Mualla would love to share with you is that she once found a rattlesnake in her boot like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_(Toy_Story)"> Woody</a> from Toy Story. Her current leadership roles consist of : Treasurer for <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/company/aggie-product-management-club"> Aggie Product Management Club </a> and TAMU Datathon Design Lead. In the past, Mualla was a social media lead for the Society of Women Engineers and Developer Student Club. Her background in marketing and design inform her mindful but competitive approach. She loves to innovate and collaborate with others to make tech more accessible & inclusive and over time she has acquired an interest in hackathons. Through personal projects and hackathons,  sheâ€™s been exploring project management, front-end development, and UI/UX Design. Outside of class, she enjoys swimming, geocaching, and trying out new things. <br>
                <br>
                Mualla has been able to develop her leadership skills further through her creation of and participation in programs like <a href = https://www.lamayor.org/mayors-youth-council"> The Mayor Youth Council </a>, Helping Seniors Club, and Student Council. After researching and planning with her peers at the Mayor Youth Council, she formed The Clean Streets March. She envisioned many eager change-seekers following her path and it came to life. She went from door to door to vocalize the impact neighbors could have by calling the mayorâ€™s office when they see trash on the streets. At the end of the walk, she registered 300 items just in one neighborhood. She listened to the issues and focused on resolutions with the student council. Ultimately, investing in <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">accessibility</a> is not only the right thing to do, but it also benefits society as a whole by removing barriers and promoting equal participation for all. <br>
                <br>
                Mualla is currently looking for summer internships in tech!
